### Alliance
To get there as an alliance character, you will make your way up to the flight point of Hearthglen in the Western Plaugelands.  Then you fly due west and can enter the monastery.

### Alliance - Druid
With a druid, you can {% include wowhead-spell.html spellId="193753" note="dreamwalk" %} to the {% include wowhead-zone.html zoneId="47" note="hinterlands" %} and take the flight path from Stormfeather Outpost to Hearthglen.

### Horde
For the horde, just take a portal to Undercity and then fly to the northeast corner of Tristfal Glades.

## The Route
You start in the Forlorn Cloister, where you need to kill the piles of corpses before moving on to the first boss of the instance while killing all mobs along the way. After killing the first boss, start making your way to the chapel.

Once you enter the chapel, take a left and start killing the mobs and looting as you go.  Make your way to Brother Korloff and put him to an end. That will open the doors to the chapel and allow you to kill all the mobs in there. Most people avoid the final boss, as there is some role play that takes time and really isn't worth the time. Make your way down the other side of the chapel area and run out of the instance, resetting after you exit the instance.  Reset and repeat.
